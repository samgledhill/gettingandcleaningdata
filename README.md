# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Class Assignment

Ths is the Class Assignment for Getting And Cleaning Data Coursera Course

The project requires us to:


> You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
> 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
> 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The file in this repo - run_analysis.R encompasses all of the steps above - starting with determining whether the local working directory contains the download file and if not present, download the data from the UCI website.

THe R script is fully commented and should be fairly self explanatory, however I have made use of the very handy "dplyr" package for this assignment.

If there are any questions regarding this analysis, I can be reached at sam-dot-gledhill-at-optusnet-dot-com-dot-au.
